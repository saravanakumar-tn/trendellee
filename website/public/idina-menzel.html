  <p>Let's be honest, Idina Menzel is a force of nature.  The woman who brought Elsa to life (and gave us the earworm that is "Let It Go") has been consistently captivating audiences for decades. It's not just the powerhouse vocals; it's the raw emotion, the vulnerability, the undeniable talent that keeps us coming back for more. </p>

  <p>Before she was Elsa, before she was Maureen in <i>Rent</i>, she was a Broadway baby, honing her craft and showing the world what she was capable of.  Her performance in <i>Wicked</i> as Elphaba is legendary, a role that continues to define her career for many.  That voice!  Those high notes!  Seriously, how does she do it?</p>
