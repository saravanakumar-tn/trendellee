       <p>Candle Day at Bath & Body Works is basically a national holiday for fragrance fanatics.  It's the one time of year when you can stock up on your favorite three-wick candles (and maybe a few you haven't tried yet!) for ridiculously low prices.  Think $12.95 (or less!) for those luxurious, room-filling scents.</p>

<p><strong>So, when is Candle Day in 2024?</strong>  Unfortunately, Bath & Body Works keeps the exact dates under wraps until closer to the event. Keep an eye on their website, social media, and email newsletters for official announcements.  Usually, it falls in January,  so start circling that month on your calendar!</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tips for Candle Day Success:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make a List (and Check it Twice!):</strong> Before the day arrives, decide which scents you absolutely *must* have.  This will help prevent impulse buys (though, let's be honest, a few are inevitable).</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Local Store:</strong>  Check out your local Bath & Body Works' hours and plan your shopping trip accordingly.  Some stores open earlier than usual, or might even have special events.</li>
<li><strong>Online vs. In-Store:</strong>  Both offer great deals, but in-store shopping gives you the chance to smell all the candles before you buy. Online shopping allows you to shop from the comfort of your home and avoid potential crowds.  Weigh the pros and cons based on your personal preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Check the Website Frequently:</strong> Bath & Body Works often has sneak peeks or hints leading up to Candle Day, so stay alert!</li>
<li><strong>Be Prepared for Crowds:</strong>  Candle Day is *popular*. Be prepared to wait in line. Be patient, friendly, and embrace the shared experience of candle love!</li>
<li><strong>Consider a shopping buddy:</strong> Having someone to help you navigate the store, grab candles from different areas and hold the line while you make a decision can save you time.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Beyond the Sale:</strong></p>
<p>Don't forget to look out for other deals throughout the year! While Candle Day is the biggest event, Bath & Body Works often has other sales and promotions throughout the year.  Sign up for their email list to stay updated.</p>

<p>Happy candle shopping!</p>
