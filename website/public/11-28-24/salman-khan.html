       <p>Salman Khan. The name itself evokes a mixed bag of reactions.  Love him or hate him, you can't ignore him.  For over three decades, he's been a fixture in Bollywood, consistently delivering hits and generating headlines, often for reasons far removed from his acting prowess.  He's the quintessential Bollywood superstar – a larger-than-life figure who embodies both immense charm and undeniable controversy.</p>

<p>His career trajectory is nothing short of legendary. From his early roles in films like <i>Maine Pyar Kiya</i>, which catapulted him to stardom, to his recent successes like <i>Antim: The Final Truth</i>, he's shown remarkable longevity.  His onscreen persona, often a blend of rugged masculinity and boyish charm, has resonated with audiences for years. Think of the iconic <i>Dabangg</i> series –  Chulbul Pandey, the quirky, powerful cop, became a cultural phenomenon.</p>

<h3>The Khan-tastic Box Office Numbers</h3>
<p>Salman's box office record speaks for itself.  He’s consistently delivered blockbuster hits, proving his enduring appeal with audiences across generations. While critics might debate his acting abilities, his films continue to attract massive audiences, making him a reliable money-spinner for producers.  The <i>Tiger</i> franchise, with its high-octane action sequences and global appeal, exemplifies this perfectly.</p>

<h3>Beyond the Silver Screen: The Controversies</h3>
<p>However, Salman's life hasn't been without its share of controversy. From legal battles to high-profile relationships, his personal life has often overshadowed his professional achievements.  These controversies, while often damaging, have, paradoxically, only added to his larger-than-life image, turning him into a figure who's almost mythologized.</p>
</section>

<p>Regardless of your opinion on the man, Salman Khan’s impact on Indian cinema is undeniable. He's a cultural icon, a box-office king, and a figure who continues to spark debate and discussion.  Whether you find him endearing or exasperating, he’s a force to be reckoned with, ensuring that the 'Sultan' will continue his reign in Bollywood for years to come.</p>
