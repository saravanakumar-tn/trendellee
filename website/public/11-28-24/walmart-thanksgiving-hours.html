       <p>Thanksgiving is almost here, which means one thing for many: shopping!  But is Walmart open on Thanksgiving?  The answer isn't always a simple yes or no.  Walmart's Thanksgiving hours have changed over the years, so it's crucial to check before you head out.</p>

<p><strong>In recent years, Walmart has generally opted to be CLOSED on Thanksgiving Day.</strong> This gives their employees a chance to spend the holiday with their families.  This is a significant shift from previous years when they opened early in the morning on Thanksgiving, often leading to intense crowds.</p>

<p><strong>However, things can change!</strong> To be absolutely sure, your best bet is to check the official Walmart website or their app.  You can usually find their store hours a week or two before Thanksgiving.  Just search for your local Walmart store and it will show you its specific hours for Thanksgiving Day – and Black Friday, which usually kicks off the next day.</p>

<p><strong>What about Black Friday?</strong>  If you’re planning your Black Friday shopping spree,  Walmart typically opens very early on Black Friday morning with amazing deals. Again, check their website or app for the precise hours and the best deals they have in your area.</p>

<p><strong>Why the change?</strong> Walmart's decision to close on Thanksgiving is partly in response to the changing attitudes towards employee work-life balance and also reflects the growing competition from online retailers. </p>

<p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Even if your local Walmart is closed on Thanksgiving, many will still have their Black Friday deals online. So, you can still get that early bird shopping in from the comfort of your home!</p>

<p><strong>Remember to always double-check the official Walmart website or app for the most accurate and up-to-date information on their Thanksgiving and Black Friday hours. Happy shopping!</strong></p>
